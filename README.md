## Abstract 
Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a networking paradigm featuring the separation of the control and data plane of the network devices. With refined centralized management and network programmability, SDN brings unique advantages as compared to traditional networks. To address the issue of scalability, the control plane is physically distributed although logically centralized. Since network traffic is both spatially and temporally dynamic, a multi-controller deployment in SDN needs a load balancing mechanism to deal with local overloads effectively.

The primary motivation behind this work is to build a framework that learns from the network traffic and aims to balance it quickly, reduce unnecessary migration overhead and get a faster response rate of the in-packet request. To this end, we use the load ratio deviation between the controllers and generate optimal migration triplets, consisting of the migrate-out and migration-in domains and a set of switches for migration. We utilize reinforcement learning under the constraint of the best efficiency and without migration conflicts to attain the global optimal controller load balancing with minimum cost. When compared with greedy and random selection approaches, our work provides better results.
